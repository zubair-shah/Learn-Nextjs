# T3 Stack

There is a new tech stack that has been gaining a lot of popularity recently. It is called the t3 Stack and is pioneered by Theo Browne a former Twitch developer now working at his company Ping. gg. The stack is referred to as t3 because of the three main technologies tRPC, TypeScript, and Tailwind. The stack also uses Next.js and Prisma, which are components, but did not fit into the naming. The main goal of this stack is to create type safety across the full stack to allow developers to write code quickly and without errors. One of the techs powering this goal is tRPC. tRPC allows you to make end-to-end typesafe APIs easily. One of the downfalls to this stack, however, is the amount of boilerplate and an intensive setup process. Once things get rolling though, this stack allows for one of the easier and safer full-stack projects.
