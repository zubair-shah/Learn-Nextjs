# Next.js Hello World with TypeScript

If youâ€™ve never written React code, you should go through the [React recorded classes](https://github.com/panacloud/bootcamp-2020#part-i-front-end-fundamentals-with-react) first. Please cover classes 1-8.

If you donot know Typescript go through this [Essential TypeScript 4: From Beginner to Pro book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/essential-typescript-4/9781484270110/). You can also watch the classes 14, 15, and 16 from [here](https://github.com/panacloud/bootcamp-2020#part-ii-programming-with-typescript)

To Create Project give the following command:

npx create-next-app step00_helloworld_typescript --ts

Lets make the project simple by deleting the api directory, all styles and their imports in pages/_app.tsx, and deleting most of the code in pages/index.tsx include the style imports. Than add a simple hello world div.

To run give the following command:

npm run dev

Now open the project in the browser:

http://localhost:3000

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
