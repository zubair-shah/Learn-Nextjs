This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.


## What is Sass?
- Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet
- Sass is an extension to CSS
- Sass is a CSS pre-processor
- Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS
- Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time
- Sass was designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006
- Sass is free to download and use

## Why Use Sass?
Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a CSS pre-processor can help. Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in functions, and other stuff.


## Instasll Sass
```bash
    yarn add sass
```

## Concepts covered in this step
- Sass variables
- Mixins
- Nesting
- Extending
- Operators
- Partials and Imports
